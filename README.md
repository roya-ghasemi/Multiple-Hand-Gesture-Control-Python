# ðŸ¤š Multiple Hand Gesture Control with OpenCV and CVZone


<video src="chose.mp4" controls></video>

This project is a practical example of multi-hand gesture detection and control using the OpenCV and CVZone libraries in Python. With this code, you can simultaneously track two hands and measure the distance between them.

## ðŸš€ Features

* Simultaneous detection and tracking of two hands
* Accurate calculation of the distance between the two hands
* Graphical display of results on webcam feed

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

* **Python 3.10**
* OpenCV
* CVZone

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Ensure you're using **Python 3.10** to run this project:

```bash
pip install opencv-python cvzone
```

## ðŸ–¥ How to Run

After installing the dependencies, run the script with:

```bash
python hand_gesture_control.py
```

Press `q` to exit the program.

## ðŸ’¡ Ideas for Further Development

* Volume control or zoom functionality using hand gestures
* Detecting and classifying various hand gestures
* Controlling different software applications via predefined gestures
