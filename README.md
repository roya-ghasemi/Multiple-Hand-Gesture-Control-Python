This project is a practical example of multi-hand gesture detection and control using the OpenCV and CVZone libraries in Python. With this code, you can simultaneously track two hands and measure the distance between them.

## 🚀 Features

* Simultaneous detection and tracking of two hands
* Accurate calculation of the distance between the two hands
* Graphical display of results on webcam feed

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* **Python 3.10**
* OpenCV
* CVZone

## 📦 Installation

Ensure you're using **Python 3.10** to run this project:

```bash
pip install opencv-python cvzone
```

## 🖥 How to Run

After installing the dependencies, run the script with:

```bash
python hand_gesture_control.py
```

Press `q` to exit the program.
